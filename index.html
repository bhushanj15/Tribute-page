                  <strong>8 Jan 1942 :</strong>
                  Stephan Hawking was born in Oxford into a family of physicians

                <li>
                    <strong> March 1966:</strong>
                    Stephan obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology.

               <li>
                <strong>Mar 1963:</strong>
                At the of age 21, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease that gradually, over decades, paralysed him. After the loss of his speech, he communicated through a speech-generating device initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle.

                  <strong>After that:</strong>
                  Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation.

                    Black body radiation that is theorized to be released outside a black hole's event horizon because of relativistic quantum effects. It is named after the physicist Stephen Hawking, who developed a theoretical argument for its existence in 1974.
                    Hawking radiation is a purely kinematic effect that is generic to Lorentzian geometries containing event horizons or local apparent horizons.

                </li>

                <li>
                    Hawking radiation reduces the mass and rotational energy of black holes and is therefore also theorized to cause black hole evaporation. Because of this, black holes that do not gain mass through other means are expected to shrink and ultimately vanish. For all except the smallest black holes, this would happen extremely slowly. The radiation temperature is inversely proportional to the black hole's mass, so micro black holes are predicted to be larger emitters of radiation than larger black holes and should dissipate faster.

                    Black holes are astrophysical objects of interest primarily because of their compact size and immense gravitational attraction.
                    A black hole can form when enough matter or energy is compressed into a volume small enough that the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light. Nothing can travel that fast, so nothing within a certain distance, proportional to the mass of the black hole, can escape beyond that distance. The region beyond which not even light can escape is the event horizon, an observer outside it cannot observe, become aware of, or be affected by events within the event horizon. The essence of a black hole is its event horizon, a theoretical demarcation between events and their causal relationships

                Hawking's most famous work is perhaps his book "A Brief History of Time" (1988), which introduced readers to complex concepts such as the Big Bang, black holes, and the nature of time in a way that was accessible to a general audience.
                Throughout his career, Hawking received numerous honors and awards, including the Albert Einstein Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He also held several prestigious academic positions, including the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, a post once held by Sir Isaac Newton.

Hawking's work has had a significant impact on the fields of physics and cosmology, and his legacy continues to inspire and influence researchers today.

            </li>
            <li>Hawking was also a vocal supporter of space exploration and human colonization of other planets, arguing that it was necessary for the survival of the human race in the long term. He even took a zero-gravity flight in 2007 to experience weightlessness, and in 2015, he and Russian billionaire Yuri Milner announced the Breakthrough Initiatives, a $100 million program to search for intelligent life in the universe.

            <li>
                Hawking's work on black holes and cosmology has had a profound impact on the field of physics and has opened up new avenues of research. His work has also helped to popularize science and make it more accessible to a wider audience.

        Despite his physical condition, Hawking was able to continue his research and make important contributions to the field of physics. He used his condition to raise awareness about the need for greater support for people with disabilities and the importance of scientific research in improving the lives of people around the world.

        Hawking's life and work serve as a powerful example of the human spirit and the determination to overcome adversity in pursuit of knowledge and understanding. His legacy continues to inspire scientists and people around the world to pursue their passions and make a positive impact on the world.
